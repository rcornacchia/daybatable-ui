MVP:
1. websockets to share posts and activity in real time
  + socket io saga
    - for emitting messages
    - for specific events from server
      + post creation
      + debate upvote/downvote
      + post upvote/downvote
2. Add timer til next debate
  + add date ended to debate object
3. HTTPS
4. email password reset
5. automating the debate transition everyday at noon

1.0:
- move sorting of posts to reducer level so it doesn't occur every render
- archives of past debates
- Create landing page
- Post argument textfield should slide in with animation
- TOKEN VALIDATION: Check for valid token, if invalid => relogin
- TOKEN should expire after a few days
- Optimize for mobile phones
- ability to create debate with Stripe payment platform
- vote buttons should animate as they stretch
- change font
- feedback
- create post form textfield should be black not blue

Nice to have:
- Comments
- Server side rendering
- Maybe use immutable js?
- robots.txt
- set up dev hot server
