feedback:
  - register
    + should automatically log you in
  - Post argument
    + should be centered
    + also shouldn't navigate you away from the main page
    + Post argument button shouldn't be uptop

MVP:
- Create landing page
- set up domain name
- BUG: Notify user if login is incorrect
- BUG: cannot GET /register or anything other than index

1.0:
- Add timer til next debate
- LOGIN FORM: let user know if combination is incorrect
- UPCOMING DEBATES
  + update about page
- POST NEW DEBATE TOPIC
  + Plus form validation
- Think about user sign on flow
  + if a user registers, should they be automatically logged in?
- TOKEN VALIDATION: Check for valid token, if invalid => relogin
- CHECK AUTH BEFORE API CALL: Before a user upvotes, make sure they're logged in. If not => ask them to log in
- HTTPS
- robots.txt

Nice to have:
- Server side rendering
- Maybe use immutable js?
