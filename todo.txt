HOW TO RECORD UPVOTES:
  + send upvote to server with userId and post
  + add upvote id to user's upvotedPosts field
  + increment post's votes by 1

FORM VALIDATION: make sure all fields are filled out

TOKEN VALIDATION: Check for valid token, if invalid => relogin
HTTPS
Server side rendering
Maybe use immutable js?


Architectural concerns:
  + How to denote current debate while saving other debates
  + How to save current user's votes to prevent double voting
