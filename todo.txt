- Add card to Login form and Post argument form
- Post argument
  + Shouldn't navigate you away from the main page
  + Post argument button shouldn't be uptop
- Add timer til next debate
  + https://codepen.io/kindofone/pen/DkhAz?editors=1100
- UPCOMING DEBATES
  + update about page
  + POST NEW DEBATE TOPIC
  + Plus form validation
- Create landing page
- update credit card info with new credit card
- create favicon

1.0:
- DEBATE ARCHIVES
- iterate on vote button

Nice to have:
- Server side rendering
- Maybe use immutable js?
- robots.txt
