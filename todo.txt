= HOW TO RECORD UPVOTES:
  + send upvote to server with userId and post
  + add upvote id to user's upvotedPosts field
  + increment post's votes by 1

= SORT POSTS BY VOTES
= FORM VALIDATION: make sure all fields are filled out
= TOKEN VALIDATION: Check for valid token, if invalid => relogin
= Before a user upvotes, make sure they're logged in. If not => ask them to log in
= HTTPS
= Server side rendering
= Maybe use immutable js?


Architectural concerns:
  + How to denote current debate while saving other debates
  + How to save current user's votes to prevent double voting
