MVP:
= fix post upvote button
= Add username (and maybe date) to Post
= Create landing page
= set up domain name

1.0:
= Add timer til next debate
= LOGIN FORM: let user know if combination is incorrect
= UPCOMING DEBATES
  + update about page
= POST NEW DEBATE TOPIC
  + Plus form validation
= Think about user sign on flow
  + if a user registers, should they be automatically logged in?
= TOKEN VALIDATION: Check for valid token, if invalid => relogin
= CHECK AUTH BEFORE API CALL: Before a user upvotes, make sure they're logged in. If not => ask them to log in
= HTTPS
= robots.txt

Nice to have:
= Server side rendering
= Maybe use immutable js?
