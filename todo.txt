To do:
= FORM VALIDATION: make sure all fields are filled out
= TOKEN VALIDATION: Check for valid token, if invalid => relogin
= CHECK AUTH BEFORE API CALL: Before a user upvotes, make sure they're logged in. If not => ask them to log in
= HTTPS

Nice to have:
= Server side rendering
= Maybe use immutable js?
